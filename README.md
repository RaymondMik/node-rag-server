# Getting Started
This is a simple Node.js application that uses the LangChain library to create embeddings for a PDF document and store them in a Supabase database. The application also includes a function to find the nearest match to a given query using the embeddings stored in the database. It uses Supabase and OpenAI as external services, make sure to check the .env.example file for the required environment variables.

Install the dependencies and run the project

```
npm install
npm start
```
